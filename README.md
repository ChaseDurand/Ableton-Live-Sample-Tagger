# AbletonLiveParser

Ableton Live Parser (ALP) is a utility for gathering and displaying basic data from a collection of Ableton Live Sets (aka project files).

Ideally I would make it do more (for example show fun facts like most used plugins and samples), but the current goal is to find and tag all samples used throughout my projects so I can know which files are safe to delete without breaking any project.

I can not overstate how hacky my implementation is.
